## Physics Engine 2D

Simple 2D physics engine using C++ / SDL. 

### TODO
- Refactor the tunams code
- Proceed to work with rigid bodies by adding shapes to our objects, like circles, boxes, and polygons.
- The collision detection and collision resolution between these rigid bodies.
- Add constraints to the physics engine, like joints and ragdolls. Constraints will help us improve the stability.
- Write a simulation of particle physics.
- Write a simulation of 2D environment.
